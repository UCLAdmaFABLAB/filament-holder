# Filament Holder for Large Spools
### Developed by the UCLA Design Media Arts Fabrication Lab

### Vitamins
Per spool:
- [3/8" x 8" stainless steel shaft](https://www.servocity.com/0-375-3-8-stainless-steel-precision-shafting)
- 2 x [.770" Set screw hub, .375" diameter](https://www.servocity.com/770-set-screw-hubs)
- 8 x [6-32 x 3/4" Machine Screw](https://www.servocity.com/6-32-zinc-plated-socket-head-machine-screws)

### Mount
![Filament holder mount](mount.png)
This file is intended to be milled out of plywood (or other flat material). By changing the `DRAW_PARTS` flag at the top of the scad file, you can generate a vector file which can be imported into your CAM software of choice. A VCarve file is provided for ShopBot users.

### Hub
Print two of these hubs for each spool. The hubs should be attached to set screw (or clamping) hubs that will allow them to be securely mounted to the shaft, holding the spool in place.

### Handle
For use when respooling. Attach to a set screw hub on the outside of the mount. Mount will need to be modified to accommodate a shaft which passes through the sides.
